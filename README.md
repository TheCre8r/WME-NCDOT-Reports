# WME North Carolina DOT Reports 

## Synopsis

This script quickly locates active closures published by NCDOT on North Carolina state-maintained roads. Active closures are retrieved from NCDOT and can be sorted by road name, description, start time and end time. Clicking on a row takes you to the approximate location of the closure.

NCDOT closures feed can be refreshed, pulling in the latest closures, using the “Refresh” icon. Additionally, there is a convenient “Archive” feature to archive any closures that have been reviewed.
